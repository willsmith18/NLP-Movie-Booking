### Example Conversation
```
🎬 NLP Movie Booking Chatbot
================================
Chatbot: Hello! I'm your assistant. What's your name?
You: Hi, I'm William
Chatbot: Nice to meet you, William! I can help you with movie bookings...

You: Show me available movies
Chatbot: Here are the available movies:
- The Matrix (150 mins, English)
- Inception (148 mins, English)
- Interstellar (169 mins, Sci-Fi)

You: I want to book The Matrix
Chatbot: You've selected The Matrix. Would you like to see available showtimes?
```

### Core Components

- **Intent Classification**: Enum-based intent system with semantic matching
- **Conversation State**: Persistent user data and session management
- **NLP Pipeline**: Text preprocessing, tokenization, and similarity scoring
- **Booking Engine**: Complete movie booking workflow with seat management

## 🧪 Testing Examples

### Intent Recognition
```python
# Test various user inputs
inputs = [
    "Hello there!",           # GREETING
    "Show me movies",         # MOVIE_SEARCH  
    "I want seat A1",         # SEAT_SELECT
    "My name is John",        # NAME_SET
    "Cancel my booking"       # BOOKING_CANCEL
]
```

### Conversation Flow
```python
# Test complete booking workflow
workflow = [
    "Hi, I'm Alice",
    "Show available movies", 
    "Book The Matrix",
    "2:30 PM showing",
    "Seat A1 and A2",
    "Confirm booking"
]
```

## 📊 Performance Metrics

- **Intent Classification Accuracy**: 83%
